     * BogoSort also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, slow sort, shotgun sort or monkey sort
     * is a particularly ineffective algorithm based on generate and test paradigm.
     * The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.(Wiki)
     * For example, if bogosort is used to sort a deck of cards,
     * it would consist of checking if the deck were in order,
     * and if it were not, one would throw the deck into the air,
     * pick the cards up at random, and repeat the process until the deck is sorted.
